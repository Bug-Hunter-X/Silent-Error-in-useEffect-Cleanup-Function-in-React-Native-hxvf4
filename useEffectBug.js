This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a cleanup function that throws an error.  This can happen if the cleanup function attempts to access or modify a component's state or props after the component has unmounted.  The error might not be immediately obvious as it is swallowed by the React Native runtime and you don't always see an error message in the console.
